Authenticate the current workflow to publish new versions or create new builds.
It works relatively simple, you define the Expo credentials, and this action will do the rest.

## Usage

First you need to define the [secrets listed below][#secrets] through [GitHub secrets](https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/storing-secrets/).
After that, you can add the action below in your workflow.

```hcl
action "Login with Expo" {
  uses = "bycedric/ci-expo/login@master"
  secrets = ["EXPO_USERNAME", "EXPO_PASSWORD"]
}
```

### Secrets

* `EXPO_USERNAME` - **Required**. The email address or username of the Expo account.
* `EXPO_PASSWORD` - **Required**. The password of the Expo account.
