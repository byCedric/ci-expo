# Expo Build iOS for GitHub Actions

> **This sub-action is no longer required and will be removed in the next release.**
> _See the [example workflows](../README.md#example-workflows) for more info._

Create a new standalone iOS build from your GitHub workflow.
Optionally, you can configure the properties of this standalone app.

> Make sure to [login](../login) before this step, else your workflow won't have the permission to build a new version

## Usage

Below you can see an example of a build iOS action.

> Just like the [publish](../publish) action, you can customize the iOS app.

```hcl
action "Build iOS app" {
  uses = "bycedric/ci-expo/build-ios@master"
}
```
